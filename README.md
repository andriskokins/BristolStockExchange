# Bristol Stock Exchange Simulation

A GUI-enhanced implementation of Dave Cliff's Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) - a simple minimal simulation of a limit order book financial exchange.

## Overview

This project extends the original Bristol Stock Exchange simulation by adding:

1. An intuitive graphical user interface for easier interaction with the simulation
2. Automated graph generation tools for visualizing trading data
3. Comprehensive analysis scripts for evaluating trading strategies
4. An ACM-style report documenting methodologies and findings

This work was completed as coursework for a [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/) module.
